# ToDoList-app

## Description
A super simple "To-do-list" type app created with jQuery. The app does not use any kind of storage so the data is not consistent.
See the live version [here](https://stefan-pop.github.io/ToDoList-app/).

## Features
* Type a task in the input and click "Add". The task will be added to a list.
* Double click on a task to slice it through or click on "X" to remove the task from the list.
* Drag a task up or down to reorder it.
